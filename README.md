# wk1-Accessibility Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description
The purpose of this project is to update the existing code to comply with accessibility standards. This project lends itself to practice semantic HTML, consolidating code blocks, creating meaningful comments, and developing command line skills.

When the website is opened (or when source code is opened in default browser), the following page should appear as shown in the image below.

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/hanks-wk1-acccessibility-challenge.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so some of the elements may appear differently on individuals' devices.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Open the webpage using the [live URL link](https://chloeeh.github.io/hanks-wk1-accessibility-challenge/) and use Chrome Developer Tools to inspect the source code. The code is commented and includes accessibility tags compared to the original code that used generic division tags.
